I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create image files or any other type of binary files. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a pin icon using a graphic design software or provide you with a description of how you might design one.

If you want to create a pin icon yourself, you can follow these general steps using a software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or any other vector graphic design tool:

1. Open your graphic design software and create a new document.
2. Use the ellipse tool to draw a circle. This will form the top part of the pin.
3. Draw a rectangle beneath the circle, with the top of the rectangle intersecting the bottom half of the circle. This will form the body of the pin.
4. Use the pen tool or a similar tool to draw the sharp end of the pin. This is typically a triangle shape that starts from the bottom of the rectangle and points downwards.
5. Select the circle and the rectangle and merge them into a single shape.
6. Apply the same process to merge the sharp end of the pin with the rest of the shape.
7. Adjust the proportions to make sure the pin looks balanced and easily recognizable. The circle (head of the pin) is usually larger in proportion to the body and the point.
8. Choose a color for your pin. Bright colors like red or blue are often used because they stand out on maps.
9. Optionally, add a shadow or a gradient to give the pin icon some depth.
10. Once you are satisfied with your design, save the file in PNG format to preserve the transparency and ensure it can be used as an icon on maps.

Remember to save your work frequently and adjust the size of the canvas to fit the icon dimensions you desire (for example, 64x64 pixels or 128x128 pixels for a high-resolution icon).

If you need a pin icon for immediate use and are unable to create one yourself, you might consider using an icon from a royalty-free website that provides icons for personal and commercial use, such as Flaticon or Icons8. Just make sure to follow the licensing agreements associated with the icon you choose.
